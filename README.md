# Description 

This package applies various machine learning techniques in data-driven physics problems. This includes

* Solving differential equations as done [Zabaras](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1901.06314.pdf) and [Karniadakis](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1711.10561.pdf) 
* Inverse modeling also done by [Zabaras](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1901.06314.pdf) and [Karniadakis](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1711.10561.pdf) 
* Learning the coefficients of PDE's as done in [Here](http://bicmr.pku.edu.cn/~dongbin/Publications/PDE-Net.pdf) 
* Learning closures in differential equations (for example in PDF equations)
